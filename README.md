# BankSim
Banking simulation project made using QT (C++), MySQL and REST API. Our group added a lot of extra functions: 90's theme, sounds and the possibility of changing the currency rates (fetched by an api request).

This project was developed to be used with an RFID card reader (in our case, Olimex MOD-RFID125), but the card number entry box can easily be modified into the main window interface.
